				<b><i>my philosophy</i></b><br/>
					I approach portrait photography rather unconventionally. A photograph is not just a document, but a piece of art. I believe the most valuable portrait photographs do three things--document an individual's physique, capture their mood or personality, and do these things in an artistic way. I value photographs that are a piece of art to the objective observer, but, to friends and family of the subject, also a memory. An invaluable keepsake. You--or you're son, daughter, parents, even pets--<i>are</i> that piece of art.<br/><br/>


				<b><i>my goal</i></b><br/>
				I want to create photographs that invoke a feeling. I want to accomplish want can't be accomplished in an indoor studio through poses and fake smiles.
				<br/></br><br/>

				<b><i>a brief background</i></b><br/>
				I've been interested in art my entire life, and view photography as the ultimate form of art and expression. My interest in photography was originally observational. Late middle school, I began experimenting myself, and a couple years later I was creating the photographs I had once admired. Of all the categories of photography, portrait particularly caught my eye. I find spontaneous, artistic portraits the most emotive of all art forms.<br/><br/>
